# Aragon DAC Team Handbook

## Team communication

* Weekly availability \(Keybase → \#check-in\): Every Monday, communicate which days you plan on working for the week: “Hey @here, this week I plan on working: M, Tu, We, Th, F, Sa, Su"
* Daily check-in \(Keybase → \#check-in\): On the days you are working give a report at the start of your work day with answers to the following:
  1. What have you completed since your last check-in?
  2. What do you plan on working on today?
  3. Do you have any blockers?
* Aragon weekly update \(RocketChat → \#check-in\): Update all Aragon teams on what you’ve been working on at the end of each week.  See examples [there](https://aragon.chat/channel/check-in) for appropriate format.
* Daily scrum \(Jitsi → AraDac\): Join the daily [Aragon DAC sync](https://meet.jit.si/AraDac). Meetings are meant to be short and cover blockers with a lower priority given to status updates. Attendance at every meeting is not required but contributors should join at least 2-3 times a week. On \(Wednesday or Monday\) everyone is expected to show and the meeting will run longer. This meeting should also have additional time for more complicated technical issues and discussions.
* Ad-hoc technical meetings: Development team can meet after the daily scrum or any other time for a deep dive on some technical issue
* Other key meetings: [see our PMO processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WT3XcnMw0LZOo0Q7gaKy_cFMGZ7xS3mUuIH9uilLNBU/edit#)

## Process guidelines

* If you are stuck on an issue for more than a day and it can’t be resolved in the daily sync then ask the Aragon One devs in the Aragon RocketChat \(\#dev or \#dev-help\). Try searching the channels first to see if it has already been discussed.
* All major feature adds must go through an approval process before work is started.

## Github guidelines

* Push your code to your working branch at the end of your work day.
* If you are working on a specific task, there should be a GitHub issue for it. Create an issue if one doesn’t already exist \(even things like “debugging babel dependency”\).  Keep the issue status up-to-date to reflect current progress.
* Ensure that there’s a 1-1 relationship between PRs and issues when appropriate.
* Before pulling in code ensure that there are tests for any new code, tests pass \(reliant on CI once it’s working\), and the full project builds.
* Before submitting a PR make sure that only changes related to the issue that PR corresponds to are listed rebasing as necessary.
